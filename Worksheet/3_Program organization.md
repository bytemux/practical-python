## Key point: Functions donâ€™t receive a copy of the input arguments.
```python
def foo(items):
    items.append(42)    # Modifies the input object

a = [1, 2, 3]
foo(a)
print(a)                # [1, 2, 3, 42]
```



## Right way to raise generic exception
```python
# essential part
try:
    go_do_something()
except Exception as e:
    print('Exception occured:', e)

# full notation
try:
    go_do_something()
except Exception as e:
    print('Exception occured:', e)
    raise # optional, pass error to the caller
finally:
    lock.release()  # this will ALWAYS be executed. With and without exception.

# modern notation
with open(filename) as f:
    # Use the file
    ...
# File closed
```

## Modules
```python
import sys
# get dict of all loaded modules
sys.modules.keys()
# paths
sys.path
```
